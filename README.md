Each version of the specification is available under a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt; tag such as 'v1.0'. Once a specification has been released, any updates to its documentation and schemas which do not modify the specification will be made available via a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt;.&lt;#UPDATE&gt; tag such as 'v1.0.1'.
