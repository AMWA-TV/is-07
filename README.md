* The [NMOS Discovery and Registration Specification](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-discovery-registration) (IS-04)
* The [NMOS Connection Management Specification](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-device-connection-management) (IS-05)

## Releases

It is recommended that the tagged releases are used as a reference for development as opposed to the 'master' or development branches of this repository.

Each version of the specification is available under a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt; tag such as 'v1.0'. Once a specification has been released, any updates to its documentation and schemas which do not modify the specification will be made available via a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt;.&lt;#UPDATE&gt; tag such as 'v1.0.1'.
