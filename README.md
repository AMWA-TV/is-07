# [Work In Progress] AMWA IS-07 NMOS Event & Tally Specification

This repository contains details of this AMWA Specification, including core models, transports, event types and a late joiners API.

## Getting started

Readers are advised to be familiar with:
* The JT-NM Reference Architecture (http://jt-nm.org/)
* The [overview of Networked Media Open Specifications](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos)

Readers should read the [documentation](docs/) in this repository.

HTML renders of this repo will be made available through [GitHub Pages](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-event-tally)

## Releases

It is recommended that the tagged releases are used as a reference for development as opposed to the 'master' or development branches of this repository.

Each version of the specification is available under a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt; tag such as 'v1.0'. Once a specification has been released, any updates to its documentation and schemas which do not modify the specification will be made available via a v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt;.&lt;#UPDATE&gt; tag such as 'v1.0.1'.
