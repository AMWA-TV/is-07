# REST API (Late joiners)

The late joiners API is meant as a protocol agnostic means by which a consumer (receiver) can get in sync with the last known state of an event emitter.

## 1. NMOS Resource

The API will be hosted under an NMOS device in the `controls` array using the `urn:x-nmos:events:query:states` type.

Example

```json
{
    "senders": [
        "a65c15a4-a52e-4960-8cd2-e05c31196e5f",
        "68f519a3-5523-4b2c-b72d-ec23cc80207d"
    ],
    "receivers": [
        "8a7bb1c1-4a82-4fd9-a4fb-96f68f560831",
        "ab450c07-ce54-44da-9ea9-c3e62e7b06d0"
    ],
    "controls": [
        {
            "type": "urn:x-nmos:control:sr-ctrl/v1.0",
            "href": "http://hostname/x-nmos/connection/v1.0/"
        },
        {
            "href": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/",
            "type": "urn:x-nmos:events:query:states/v1.0/"
        }
    ],
    "tags": {},
    "type": "urn:x-nmos:device:generic",
    "label": "Events Device",
    "version": "1529676926:000000000",
    "node_id": "d1713110-7343-4d9e-b3f4-456c8f6ce765",
    "id": "58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125",
    "description": "Events Engine Device"
}
```

## 2. Usage

Clients need to append `/senders/` and a sender id to the href in order to access the state of that sender via a `GET` request.
The response will always be the current state of the emitter as if the receiver would have received the state using its transport protocol.

Example request:  

`GET http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/senders/a65c15a4-a52e-4960-8cd2-e05c31196e5f`

Example response:  

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "source_id": "5b72552a-f3ae-4afb-9ed5-aab74e5c53c8",
    "flow_id": "5b72552a-f3ae-4afb-9ed5-aab74e5c53c8"
  },
  "timing": {
    "origin_timestamp": "1529323551:000000000",
    "action_timestamp": "1529323551:000000000"
  },
  "event_type": "boolean",
  "payload": {
    "value": true
  }
}
```

## 3. Cases to avoid

This API is only meant for consumer late joiners to synchronise with emitters and shall not be used for regular high intensity polling of states.
