# Message types

_(c) AMWA 2018, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

This document specifies the supported message types and the strategies employed to define them.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0.%20Overview.md).

## 1. Introduction

The main concern of the Event & Tally specification is to make possible for emitters to transmit their state changes to any interested consumer.
A secondary concern is to give connected entities a mechanism by which to highlight issues in the linkage between them. In order to address this concern the `message_type` field will be added as a field in every single event message being sent.

These are the supported message types:

* state
* reboot
* shutdown
* connection_lost (only used by MQTT connections)
* health (only used by WebSocket connections)

For clarity, all MQTT message types are sent using the same MQTT topic defined through the transport parameter `broker_topic`.

### 1.1. The state message type

The `state` message type will always be sent when the emitter changes state and issues a new event or in a response to a query state request to the [Event & Tally REST API](6.0.%20Event%20and%20tally%20rest%20api.md).  
These will be the predominant message types being sent in an Event & Tally system.

The message structure shall have the following items:

* identity [mandatory]
* event_type [mandatory]
* timing [mandatory with some optional fields]
* payload [mandatory]
* message_type [mandatory]

Message structure

```json
{
    "identity":
    {
        "source_id": "6cbd0441-7882-44cd-9557-842243a0d618",
        "flow_id": "ff455cf3-fb17-448b-8f4c-e6c0e294f5ed"
    },
    "event_type": "boolean",
    "timing":
    {
        "creation_timestamp": "1531680501:280709600",
        "origin_timestamp": "1531680501:280401700",
        "action_timestamp": "1531680501:320000000"
    },
    "payload":
    {
        "value": true
    },
    "message_type": "state"
}
```

The `"creation_timestamp"` represents the timestamp at which an event has been created (for sensors this is the acquisition time). This field is mandatory.  

The `"origin_timestamp"` represents the timestamp which led to the creation of an event due to external factors (a trigger). This field is optional.  

The `"action_timestamp"` represents the timestamp at which an event should be treated or result in an action (for synchronising and dealing with delays). This field is optional.

The `"action_timestamp"` is not intended to be associated with delays of more than a few seconds, not for example to allow events scheduled in the future, it allows synchronisation of events in complex workflows.

The payload depends on the associated event_type (see [Event types](3.0.%20Event%20types.md)).

The `flow_id` will _NOT_ be included in the response to a rest apy query state because the state is held by the source which has no dependency on a flow. It will, however, appear when being sent through one of the two specified transports because it will pass from the source through a flow and out on the network through the sender.

### 1.2. The reboot message type

The `reboot` message type will only be sent when the event emitter (source) is going to experience a planned restart. This message will announce any connected consumers that the emitter will momentarily be unavailable. The recommendation for receivers is to attempt to reconnect to the sender after a user configurable amount of time (on the receiver side) and if the WebSocket connection cannot be established or the consumer does not receive a fresh state from the MQTT broker (fresh in this context meaning more recent timestamps) to park the subscription and update the IS-04 model in the registry.

The message structure shall have the following items:

* identity [mandatory]
* timing [mandatory]
* message_type [mandatory]

Message structure

```json
{
  "identity":{
    "source_id": "6cbd0441-7882-44cd-9557-842243a0d618",
    "flow_id": "ff455cf3-fb17-448b-8f4c-e6c0e294f5ed"
  },
  "timing":{
    "creation_timestamp": "1531680501:280709600"
  },
  "message_type": "reboot"
}
```

The `"creation_timestamp"` represents the timestamp at which the emitter established that a `reboot` action will follow. This field is mandatory.

### 1.3. The shutdown message

The `shutdown` message type will only be sent when the event emitter (sender) is going to experience a planned shutdown. This message will announce any connected consumers that the emitter will become unavailable. The recommendation for receivers is to park their subscription and update their IS-04 model in the registry.

The message structure shall have the following items:

* identity [mandatory]
* timing [mandatory]
* message_type [mandatory]

Message structure

```json
{
  "identity":{
    "source_id": "6cbd0441-7882-44cd-9557-842243a0d618",
    "flow_id": "ff455cf3-fb17-448b-8f4c-e6c0e294f5ed"
  },
  "timing":{
    "creation_timestamp": "1531680501:280709600"
  },
  "message_type": "shutdown"
}
```

The `"creation_timestamp"` represents the timestamp at which the emitter established that a `shutdown` action will follow. This field is mandatory.

### 1.4. The connection lost message

The `connection_lost` message is going to be sent by all emitters as an `MQTT WILL message` to the MQTT broker. This shall be done upon first connection to the broker.
If the emitter ungracefully disconnects from the MQTT broker, the `connection_lost WILL` message will be sent by the broker to all consumers subscribed to its topic. Hence, the `connection_lost` message will only be used with MQTT connections, see [MQTT transport](5.1.%20Transport%20-%20MQTT.md).

This message will always use the `connection_status_broker_topic` parameter as the publishing topic.

The recommendation for receivers is to check for a fresh state (fresh in this context meaning more recent timestamps) after a user configurable amount of time, and if no state is received from the broker to park the subscription and update the IS-04 model in the registry.

The message structure shall have the following items:

* message_type [mandatory]

Message structure

```json
{  
  "message_type": "connection_lost"
}
```

For more information about `MQTT WILL` messages consult the MQTT specification and other MQTT materials:

* https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-9-last-will-and-testament

### 1.5. The health message

The `health` message will only be sent on a WebSocket connection as a response to a `health` command see [Websocket transport](5.2.%20Transport%20-%20Websocket.md).

The recommendation for receivers is to detect missing `health` responses (no `health` response is sent back within 5 seconds) and after a 12 seconds timeout (two consecutive missed `health` responses plus 2 seconds to allow for latencies) either attempt to reconnect to the WebSocket and re-initialise the subscriptions list or park the subscription and update the IS-04 model in the registry.

The message structure shall have the following items:

* timing [mandatory with some optional fields]
* message_type [mandatory]

Message structure

```json
{  
  "timing":{
    "origin_timestamp": "1441974485:12300000",
    "creation_timestamp": "1441974485:23400000"
  },
  "message_type": "health"
}
```

The `"creation_timestamp"` represents the health timestamp introduced by the sender. This field is mandatory.  

The `"origin_timestamp"` represents the original health timestamp sent by the receiver. This field is optional.
