# Event types

_(c) AMWA 2018, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

This document specifies the supported event types and the strategies employed to define them.

These are the supported event types:

* boolean
* string
* number
* measurement
* number enum
* string enum
* complex

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0%20Overview.md).

## 1. boolean

The `boolean` event type will be identified as `"boolean"` in the NMOS flow.

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* restrict the `value` data type [M]

```json
{
    "value": true
}
```

Examples:  
A switch on position condition is either true or false  
A simple button pressed condition is either true or false

## 2. string

The `string` event type will be identified as `"string"` in the NMOS flow.

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* restrict the `value` data type [M]
* indicate minimum length [O]
* indicate maximum length [O]

```json
{
    "value": "my label"
}
```

Examples:  
A simple label on a button or on another UI element.

## 3. number

The `number` event type will be identified as `"number"` in the NMOS flow.

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* indicate an optional `scale` field [O] - for representing rational numbers
* restrict the `value` data type [M]
* indicate minimum value [M]
* indicate maximum value [M]
* indicate step value [O]

Payload examples:

integer

```json
{
    "value": 20
}
```

floating point

```json
{
    "value": 1.0
}
```

rational

```json
{
    "value": 1,
    "scale": 3
}
```

For rational numbers the `value` represents the `numerator` and the scale represents the `denominator`

Examples:  
Packet count

## 4. measurement

The `measurement` event type will always describe a measurement with an associated measurement unit.

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* restrict the `value` data type [M]
* indicate minimum value [M]
* indicate maximum value [M]
* indicate step value [O]
* indicate the measurement unit [M]

The `measurement` event type will be identified as `"measurement/{Name}/{Unit}"` in the NMOS flow, where `Name` is the name of the measurement and `Unit` is the measurement unit.

A recommended strategy for naming measurement units needs to be published for common measurements.

Examples:  
number/Temperature/C

Payload example:

```json
{
    "value": 22.4
}
```

## 5. number enum

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* restrict the `value` data type [M]
* indicate all the possible value options [M]
* indicate a label for all the possible value options [M]
* indicate a description for all possible value options [M]

The `number enum` event type will be identified as `"number/enum/{Name}"` in the NMOS flow, where `Name` is the name of the enum.

Examples:  
number/enum/StudioCondition

Payload example:

```json
{
    "value": 0
}
```

Possible options example:

```json
[
    {
        "value": 0,
        "label": "idle",
        "description": "Studio condition is idle"
    },
    {
        "value": 1,
        "label": "reh",
        "description": "Studio condition is rehearsal"
    },
    {
        "value": 2,
        "label": "tx",
        "description": "Studio condition is tx"
    }
]
```

## 6. string enum

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will:

* require a `value` field [M]
* restrict the `value` data type [M]
* indicate all the possible value options [M]
* indicate a label for all the possible value options [M]
* indicate a description for all possible value options [M]

The `string enum` event type will be identified as `"string/enum/{Name}"` in the NMOS flow, where `Name` is the name of the enum.

Examples:  
string/enum/DeviceStatus

Payload example:

```json
{
    "value": "ok"
}
```

Possible options example:

```json
[
    {
        "value": "unknown",
        "label": "Device state is unknown",
        "description": "Device state is unknown. Check extension card is plugged in correctly."
    },
    {
        "value": "ok",
        "label": "Device state is ok",
        "description": "Device state is ok."
    },
    {
        "value": "warn",
        "label": "Device state is warning",
        "description": "Device state is warning. PSU 1 shows signs of failure."
    },
    {
        "value": "fail",
        "label": "Device state is fail",
        "description": "Device state is fail. No PTP reference found."
    }
]
```

## 7. complex

The event type will be associated with a definition file hosted in an NMOS sender `"manifest_href"` field.

This definition file will describe the payload types and metadata associated in detail.

The `complex` event type will be identified as `"complex/{Name}"` in the NMOS flow, where `Name` is the name of the enum.

It is important to only use the `complex` event type if all other options have been exhausted (the state we wish to send cannot possible fit in any of the above types). It may be that splitting the complex state into simpler states allows us to send them invididually as simpler types.

## Event types capability management

Flow `"event_type"` fields always need to have an exact specific event type.

Receivers `"event_types"` field can have a specific event type or may have a derived partial event type using a wildcard (`*`).

More details about NMOS resources in the section [Core models](3.0 Core_models.md).

The wildcard allows a smart receiver to advertise a wider capability with a specific category above. This is useful information when building a user interface which handles connection management but also matches capabilities between senders and receivers.

An example of a receiver which may use a wildcard could be a smart software gauge which can autocalibrate. This could advertise its capability as `measurement/*`.

Another example could be for a temperature receiver which supports any measurement unit. This could advertise its capability as `measurement/Temperature/*`.

Finally a temperature receiver which only supports degrees Celcius would advertise its capability as `measurement/Temperature/C`.
