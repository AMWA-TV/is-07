# AMQP Transport

Highlights:

* Complex and flexible with different topologies and plugins
* Broker based
* Can be used on top of TCP or WebSocket
* Can use encryption
* Supports various QOS settings for message delivery
* Does not inherently solve the problem of late joiners
* Events filtering is handled by the broker with topic filtering mechanics

## 1. NMOS Resources transport

NMOS resources using AMQP will use the `urn:x-nmos:transport:amqp` transport.

## 2. Connection management

Only use IS-05 connection management going forward.

For AMQP connections two new transport parameters need to exist:

* amqp_topic
* late_joiners_url

### 2.1 amqp_topic

The `amqp_topic` parameter will always be set to the sender id.

### 2.2 late_joiners_url

The `late_joiners_url` parameter will represent the url to the API path which offers the current state of an event emitter (see [REST API (Late joiners)](7.0%20Rest_api_late_joiners.md))

Example of IS-05 PATCH request

```json
{
    "sender_id": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
    "master_enable": true,
    "activation": {
        "mode": "activate_immediate",
        "requested_time": null
    },
    "transport_params": [
        {
            "amqp_topic": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
            "late_joiners_url": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/senders/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b/"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 3. QOS Settings

TBD

## 3. Late joiners

Consumers (receivers) query the late joiners api using `late_joiners_url` to access the latest state of an emitter in order to get in sync.

## 4. Broker discovery

The AMQP broker will be advertised via mDNS with `_nmos-events_broker-amqp`
