# MQTT Transport

_(c) AMWA 2018, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

This document describes the use of the MQTT transport.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0.%20Overview.md).

## 1. Introduction

* Simple and lightweight
* Broker based
* Can be used on top of TCP or WebSockets
* Can use encryption
* Supports various QOS settings for message delivery
* Inherently solves the problem of late joiners using retained messages
* Events filtering is handled by the broker with topic filtering mechanics

## 2. NMOS Resources transport

NMOS resources using MQTT will use the `urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt` transport.

## 3. Connection management

Only IS-05 connection management will be used for connection management of resources defined in this specification.

### 3.1 broker_topic

The `broker_topic` parameter will hold the MQTT topic and will always be set to the source id, prefixed with `x-nmos/source/` for easier filtering.

### 3.2 rest_api_url

The `rest_api_url` parameter will represent the url to the API path which offers the current state and type of an event emitter (source) (see [Event & Tally REST API](6.0.%20Event_and_tally_rest_api.md))

It is important for the controller to always populate the `rest_api_url` field using the following template:  
`{is_05_control_base_url}`sources/`{source_id_associated_with_sender}`/  
The controller will populate `is_05_control_base_url` as being the href offered by the `urn:x-nmos:events:query/v1.0` control in the controls array of the sender device.  
The controller will populate `source_id_associated_with_sender` as being the unique ID of the source associated with the sender.  
For consistency the `rest_api_url` url offered will always end with a trailing slash.

A receiver should always expect the `rest_api_url` to follow the format above and only needs to append one of the following suffixes:

* state (to retrieve the current state of the emitter)
* type (to retrieve the metadata associated with the event_type of the emitter)

_Example of IS-05 PATCH request_

```json
{
    "sender_id": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
    "master_enable": true,
    "activation": {
        "mode": "activate_immediate",
        "requested_time": null
    },
    "transport_params": [
        {
            "broker_topic": "x-nmos/source/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
            "rest_api_url": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b/"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 4. QOS Settings

MQTT publishers are recommended to use the `exactly once QOS (2)`

## 5. Late joiners

MQTT publishers are required to send the `retained message` flag with every message in order to solve the problem of late joiners.

Consumers (receivers) have a choice to either use the retained message or query the late joiners api using `rest_api_url` to access the latest state of an emitter in order to get in sync.

## 6. Broker discovery

The MQTT broker will be advertised via the DNS-SD service type `_nmos-mqtt`.
