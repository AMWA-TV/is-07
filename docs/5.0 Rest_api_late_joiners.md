# REST API (Late joiners)

This document describes the use of the event & tally REST API.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0%20Overview.md).

## 1. Introduction

The late joiners API is meant as a protocol agnostic means by which a consumer (receiver) can get in sync with the last known state of an event emitter. The API *has to be* used only together with other event based transports to minimize the load on the device allowing for better scalability. The main purpose of the API is resolving the problem of late joiners but it can be also used for low-frequency sanity checks of the states for signals that change states very rarely.

## 2. NMOS Resource

The API will be hosted under an NMOS device in the `controls` array using the `urn:x-nmos:events:query:states` type.

Example

```json
{
    "senders": [
        "a65c15a4-a52e-4960-8cd2-e05c31196e5f",
        "68f519a3-5523-4b2c-b72d-ec23cc80207d"
    ],
    "receivers": [
        "8a7bb1c1-4a82-4fd9-a4fb-96f68f560831",
        "ab450c07-ce54-44da-9ea9-c3e62e7b06d0"
    ],
    "controls": [
        {
            "type": "urn:x-nmos:control:sr-ctrl/v1.0",
            "href": "http://hostname/x-nmos/connection/v1.0/"
        },
        {
            "type": "urn:x-nmos:events:query:states/v1.0",
            "href": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/"
        }
    ],
    "tags": {},
    "type": "urn:x-nmos:device:generic",
    "label": "Events Device",
    "version": "1529676926:000000000",
    "node_id": "d1713110-7343-4d9e-b3f4-456c8f6ce765",
    "id": "58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125",
    "description": "Events Engine Device"
}
```

## 3. Usage

Clients need to append `/sources/` and a source id to the href in order to access the state of that source via a `GET` request.
The response will always be the current state of the emitter as if the receiver would have received the state using its transport protocol.

Example request:  

`GET http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/a65c15a4-a52e-4960-8cd2-e05c31196e5f`

Example response:  

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "source_id": "a65c15a4-a52e-4960-8cd2-e05c31196e5f"
  },
  "timing": {
    "creation_timestamp": "1529323551:016020406",
    "action_timestamp": "1529323551:100000000"
  },
  "event_type": "boolean",
  "payload": {
    "value": true
  }
}
```

## 4. Cases to avoid

This API is only meant for consumer late joiners to synchronise with emitters and shall not be used for regular high intensity polling of states.
