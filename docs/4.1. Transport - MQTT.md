# MQTT Transport

_(c) AMWA 2018, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

This document describes the use of the MQTT transport.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0.%20Overview.md).

## 1. Introduction

* Simple and lightweight
* Broker based
* Can be used on top of TCP or WebSockets
* Can use encryption
* Supports various QOS settings for message delivery
* Inherently solves the problem of late joiners using retained messages
* Events filtering is handled by the broker with topic filtering mechanics

## 2. NMOS Resources transport

NMOS resources using MQTT will use the `urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt` transport.

## 3. Connection management

Only IS-05 connection management will be used for connection management of resources defined in this specification.

### 3.1 broker_topic

The `broker_topic` parameter will hold the MQTT topic and will always be set to the source id, prefixed with `x-nmos/source/` for easier filtering.

### 3.2 rest_api_url

The `rest_api_url` parameter will represent the url to the API path which offers the current state and type of an event emitter (source) (see [REST API (Late joiners)](5.0.%20Rest_api_late_joiners.md))

_Example of IS-05 PATCH request_

```json
{
    "sender_id": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
    "master_enable": true,
    "activation": {
        "mode": "activate_immediate",
        "requested_time": null
    },
    "transport_params": [
        {
            "broker_topic": "x-nmos/source/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
            "rest_api_url": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b/"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 4. QOS Settings

MQTT publishers are recommended to use the `exactly once QOS (2)`

## 5. Late joiners

MQTT publishers are required to send the `retained message` flag with every message in order to solve the problem of late joiners.

Consumers (receivers) have a choice to either use the retained message or query the late joiners api using `rest_api_url` to access the latest state of an emitter in order to get in sync.

## 6. Broker discovery

The MQTT broker will be advertised via the DNS-SD service type `_nmos-mqtt`.
