# Overview

The purpose of the Event & Tally specification is to provide a mechanism by which to emit and consume state changes issued by sources (sensors, actuators etc). This is by no means a control API and controlling or sending commands to a receiver is out of scope. States sent need to be for general consumption which is to say they should not be sent with a specific receiver in mind (all states need to be consumable by any compatible receiver).

The specification is split into the following sections:

* [Event types](2.0%20Event_types.md)
* [Core models](3.0%20Core_models.md)
* [MQTT transport](4.0%20MQTT_transport.md)
* [Websocket transport](5.0%20Websocket_transport.md)
* [AMQP transport](6.0%20AMQP_transport.md)
* [Late joiners](7.0%20Late_joiners_api.md)
