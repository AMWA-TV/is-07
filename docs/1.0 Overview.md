## 1. Documentation

The documents included in this directory provide additional details and recommendations for implementations of the defined API, and its consumers.

## 2. Introduction

The purpose of the Event & Tally specification is to provide a mechanism by which to emit and consume states and state changes issued by sources (sensors, actuators etc). This is by no means a control API and controlling or sending commands to a receiver is out of scope. States sent need to be for general consumption which is to say they should not be sent with a specific receiver in mind (all states need to be consumable by any compatible receiver).

The specification is split into the following sections:

* [Event types](2.0%20Event_types.md)
* [Core models](3.0%20Core_models.md)
* Transports
  * [MQTT transport](4.1%20MQTT_transport.md)
  * [Websocket transport](4.2%20Websocket_transport.md)
  * [AMQP transport](4.3%20AMQP_transport.md)
* [REST API (Late joiners)](5.0%20Rest_api_late_joiners.md)
