# Transports

This document lists the mandatory transports required for this specification.
Both of these transports shall be supported by any valid IS-07 implementation with the view that it is the end user who shall decide which of the transports are going to be marked as operational in their system (it may be one of the two or both of them).  
Any IS-07 viable product should have both transport options as mandatory capabilities which can be turned on/off operationally.  
For clarity the minimum requirement is that both transports can be made operational. Optionally the product may allow the user to disable the operational use of one of the transports for processing/memory savings.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](Overview.md).

Mandatory supported transports:

* [MQTT](Transport%20-%20MQTT.md)
* [WebSocket](Transport%20-%20Websocket.md)
