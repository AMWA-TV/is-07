This document describes the use of the WebSocket transport.

## 1. Introduction

* Brokerless
* Supports encryption
* Web app friendly
* Every sender device needs to run a server
* The problem of late joiners can be solved as the server can send initial states upon connection
* Events filtering needs to happen within the sender device

The NMOS Events & Tally community has shown interest in using the WebSocket protocol as a transport for events and tally information as it is a familiar protocol which has already been used in the NMOS ecosystem.
There is an ongoing debate about WebSocket topologies being less efficient than broker based transport topologies like MQTT in a large-scale system because each sending device needs to host its own server to cope with demand. One of the cases we have identified which could be improved is when a device hosts multiple receivers which are interested in multiple senders on another device. In a simple receiver to sender connection mapping a connection would be required from each receiver to each sender. This could be improved with a device subscriptions model whereby you would only have a single connection between the devices with a subscriptions list.

With that in mind, going forward you will see concepts such as server and client which represent the senders’ collection and the interested receivers’ collection. Furthermore, even though there will only be a single websocket url hosted by the sender device each client will have its own communication channel with the server with unique subscriptions.

## 2. Websocket server uri

The Websocket server will be hosted under an NMOS sender device. The uri will be exposed in the `connection_uri` transport parameter by the IS-05 v1.1 compliant sender.

## 3. Connection management

Only IS-05 connection management will be used for connection management of resources defined in this specification.

### 3.1 connection_uri

The `connection_uri` parameter will be the url of the websocket server. All senders on one NMOS device should offer the same `connection_uri` to allow the number of websocket connections needed to be reduced. It may be appropriate for the same `connection_uri` to be offered for the senders of all devices on a node.
Filtering will be achieved using the subscription mechanism explained in the following sections.

### 3.2 ext_is_07_rest_api_url

The `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` parameter will represent the url to the API path which offers the current state and type of an event emitter (source) (see [Event & Tally REST API](6.0.%20Event%20and%20tally%20rest%20api.md))

## 3.3 ext_is_07_source_id

The `ext_is_07_source_id` transport parameter represents the source id which is the emitter of the event. This is required for the websocket client to be able to build the subscriptions required from the server. Furthermore, the source id is required to filter and help the client determine which of the connected receivers needs to be notified when an event is consumed.

_Example of IS-05 PATCH request_

```json
{
    "sender_id": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
    "master_enable": true,
    "activation": {
        "mode": "activate_immediate",
        "requested_time": null
    },
    "transport_params": [
        {
            "connection_uri": "ws://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/devices/58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125",
            "ext_is_07_source_id": "9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
            "ext_is_07_rest_api_url": "http://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b/"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Disconnecting/Parking

A disconnection IS-05 `patch` request should always trigger the client to remove the associated `source id` from the current websocket subscription list.
If the source is the last item in the subscription list, then it is recommended for the client to close the underlying websocket connection.

## 4. Subscriptions strategy

Upon connection, a client needs to initialise its subscription list by sending a subscription command on the WebSocket channel.

After establishing the subscription list, the client will start receiving events only for the items it has subscribed to.
A client may choose to add or remove items to its subscription at any point in time.

Each time a client updates its subscriptions list (sends a new subscription command), the server will resend all the current states for each of the subscribed sources. If a client needs to reconnect, then the WebSocket session context needs to be re-established so the client will send a new subscription command re-initialising its subscription.

A subscription command will only get sent out as a consequence of an NMOS Connection Management action or a reconnection.

### 4.1 Heartbeats

Upon connection, the client is required to report its health every 5 seconds in order to maintain its session and subscription. This is similar to the behaviour required by the registry for nodes in IS-04 specification. Every `health` command should be followed by a `health` response (see [Message types](2.0.%20Message%20types.md)).  
The server is expected to check `health` commands and after a 12 seconds timeout (2 consecutive missed `health` commands plus 2 seconds to allow for latencies) it should clear the subscriptions for that particular client and close the websocket connection. The server is also required to respond to a heartbeat within 5 seconds of receiving the `health` command.

Example health command

```json
{
  "command": "health",
  "timestamp": "1441974485:12300000"
}
```

Example health response

```json
{  
  "timing":{
    "origin_timestamp": "1441974485:12300000",
    "creation_timestamp": "1441974485:23400000"
  },
  "message_type": "health"
}
```

### 4.2 Connection logic flow

#### Step 1

The client connects to the `websocket_href` websocket session.

#### Step 2

The client establishes a subscriptions list by sending a `subscription` command.

Example

```json
{
  "command": "subscription",
  "sources": [
    "772116e0-b4ba-43b1-9ffc-70287c17cb9e",
    "674e32cb-84b5-475e-b7db-7821530c4375"
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3

The client receives the initial state for each source in its subscription list thus solving the problem of late joiners.

#### Step 4

The client continues to receive events only from the subscribed sources.

#### Step 5

The client issues health commands every 5 seconds as described above.

## 5. Late joiners

As described above a client will receive the initial states for all the sources in its subscription list.

A client may also choose to query the Event & Tally REST API using `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` to access the latest state of an emitter in order to verify the current state.
