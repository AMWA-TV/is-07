# Core models

_(c) AMWA 2018, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

This document specifies the core models and strategies employed.

Other sections can be accessed from the [Overview](1.0.%20Overview.md).

## 1. Introduction

The following transports are supported:

* [MQTT](5.1.%20Transport%20-%20MQTT.md)
* [WebSocket](5.2.%20Transport%20-%20Websocket.md)

The v1.0 specification relies on the following existing specifications:

* IS-04 v1.3
* IS-05 v1.1

In terms of relationships and workflows the following diagram shows an example:

![NMOS Overview diagram](images/nmos-overview-diagram.png)

The diagram does not aim to show any ownership but instead relationships and workflows. A source is the emitter of a particular type of event and plays a vital role in identity. A flow describes the media type for the associated event type. A sender reflects the transport used to package a particular flow on to the network and a receiver is capable of receiving a set of event types using a particular transport.

## 2. IS-04 highlights

### 2.1. Sources

Event sources have a new field called `event_type` in order to describe the event type emitted.
Event sources use the `urn:x-nmos:format:data` format.

Example:

```json
{
    "tags": {},
    "caps": {},
    "parents": [],
    "description": "Vision Mixer In 5 Active",
    "format": "urn:x-nmos:format:data",
    "label": "Vision Mixer In 5 Active",
    "id": "7a855001-0a87-4ce1-b490-b9d648cd6566",
    "device_id": "9ce6993a-db5f-47c9-babe-ee956945006d",
    "version": "1530806114:000000000",
    "clock_name": null,
    "event_type": "boolean"
}
```

### 2.2 Flows

Event flows also have a new `event_type` field.
Event flows use the `urn:x-nmos:format:data` format and have the media type set to `application/json`.

Example:

```json
{
    "tags": {},
    "parents": [],
    "description": "Virtual Button 1",
    "format": "urn:x-nmos:format:data",
    "label": "Virtual Button 1",
    "id": "ff455cf3-fb17-448b-8f4c-e6c0e294f5ed",
    "source_id": "7b9d4864-5d6d-4227-a81d-8dd3e13e99b3",
    "version": "1529676926:000000000",
    "media_type": "application/json",
    "event_type": "boolean",
    "device_id": "58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125"
}
```

### 2.3 Senders

The supported transports have been extended to include:

* `urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt`
* `urn:x-nmos:transport:websocket`

Neither of these transport types require a transport file (`manifest_href`).

Example:

```json
{
    "tags": {},
    "interface_bindings": [
        "eth0"
    ],
    "subscription": {
        "receiver_id": null,
        "active": false
    },
    "description": "Virtual Button 1",
    "transport": "urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt",
    "label": "Virtual Button 1",
    "id": "68f519a3-5523-4b2c-b72d-ec23cc80207d",
    "device_id": "58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125",
    "flow_id": "0554b43a-ea7c-418d-a39e-1205ee281af3",
    "manifest_href": null,
    "version": "1529676926:000000000"
}
```

### 2.4. Receivers

Event receivers have a new array called `event_types` inside the `caps` field in order to list all of the event types they can consume (more details in [Event types](3.0.%20Event%20types.md)).  
Event receivers use the `urn:x-nmos:format:data` format and if the `media_types` array is present inside the `caps` field, it must include `application/json`.

The supported transports have been extended to include:

* `urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt`
* `urn:x-nmos:transport:websocket`

Example:

```json
{
    "tags": {},
    "caps": {
        "media_types": [
            "application/json"
        ],
        "event_types": [
            "boolean"
        ]
    },
    "interface_bindings": [
        "eth0"
    ],
    "description": "Virtual Lamp 1",
    "format": "urn:x-nmos:format:data",
    "transport": "urn:x-nmos:transport:mqtt",
    "label": "Virtual Lamp 1",
    "id": "8a7bb1c1-4a82-4fd9-a4fb-96f68f560831",
    "device_id": "58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125",
    "version": "1529676926:000000000",
    "subscription": {
        "sender_id": null,
        "active": false
    }
}
```

## 3. NMOS Parameter Registers highlights

Event devices have an additional control in the `controls` array for the Events API (see [Events API](6.0.%20Event%20and%20tally%20rest%20api.md)).

The definition for this control is detailed with an entry in the NMOS Parameter Registers.

## 4. IS-05 highlights

### 4.1. MQTT sender transport parameters

The following transport parameters are exposed (as defined for the MQTT transport in the IS-05 specification):

* `destination_host`
* `destination_port`
* `broker_protocol`
* `broker_authorization`
* `broker_topic`
* `connection_status_broker_topic`

In addition, this specification defines the following additional parameter:

* `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` (the URL of the Events API resource for the associated source)

`ext_is_07_rest_api_url` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.

### 4.2. WebSocket sender transport parameters

The following transport parameters are exposed (as defined for the WebSocket transport in the IS-05 specification):

* `connection_uri`
* `connection_authorization`

In addition, this specification defines the following additional parameters:

* `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` (the URL of the Events API resource for the associated source)
* `ext_is_07_source_id` (the event source id used for filtering subscriptions)

`ext_is_07_rest_api_url` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.
`ext_is_07_source_id` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.

### 4.3. MQTT receiver transport parameters

The following transport parameters are exposed (as defined for the MQTT transport in the IS-05 specification):

* `source_host`
* `source_port`
* `broker_protocol`
* `broker_authorization`
* `broker_topic`
* `connection_status_broker_topic`

In addition, this specification defines the following additional parameter:

* `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` (the URL of the Events API resource for the associated source)

`ext_is_07_rest_api_url` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.

### 4.4. WebSocket receiver transport parameters

The following transport parameters are exposed (as defined for the WebSocket transport in the IS-05 specification):

* `connection_uri`
* `connection_authorization`

In addition, this specification defines the following additional parameters:

* `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` (the URL of the Events API resource for the associated source)
* `ext_is_07_source_id` (the event source id used for filtering subscriptions)

`ext_is_07_rest_api_url` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.
`ext_is_07_source_id` schemas and examples are defined in IS-07 following the IS-05 templates.

### 4.5. Ext_ transport parameters

All of the `ext_` transport parameters mentioned in the previous sections follow the same templates as the IS-05 core parameters. They are supported by associated schemas, examples, constrains and staged/active entries. These are defined in the IS-07 specification as opposed to the core transport parameters defined in IS-05.

#### ext_is_07_rest_api_url

The `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` parameter represents the URL to the Events API resource which offers the current state and type of an event emitter (source) (see [Events API](6.0.%20Event%20and%20tally%20rest%20api.md))

The sender should populate the `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` field by starting with the `href` offered by the `urn:x-nmos:control:events/v1.0` control in the `controls` array of the IS-04 device associated with the sender.
The sender should append the relative path `sources/{source_id}/`, where the `source_id` is the unique ID of the source associated with the sender (see `ext_is_07_source_id`).

A receiver can expect the `ext_is_07_rest_api_url` to follow the format above and need only append one of the following relative paths:

* `state` (to retrieve the current state of the emitter)
* `type` (to retrieve the type definition object associated with the emitter)

Implementations may encounter URLs with or without a trailing slash. In order to avoid cases of double slashes or missing slashes, implementations are required to exercise caution when appending paths.

#### ext_is_07_source_id

The `ext_is_07_source_id` transport parameter represents the source id which is the emitter of the event. The sender will populate this with its associated source id.

### 4.6. Connection management

Event & Tally connection management only supports IS-05 connection management (the legacy IS-04 connection management is not supported and deprecated).

The usage of the transport parameters identified in the previous sections is detailed in each [transport](5.0.%20Transports.md) section and in the [Events API](6.0.%20Event%20and%20tally%20rest%20api.md) section.
